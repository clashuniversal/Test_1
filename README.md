The Chrome plugin when clicked will copy the backend ticket ID of the last loaded Freshdesk ticket URL to your clipboard,
so that you can paste it into haystack, without additional clicks or opening the ticket URL. This should be handy when checking logs
for multiple tickets in multiple tabs.

How does the extension work:
1. Load a ticket URL in a Chrome tab
(If you are opening a ticket URL from the list view use Ctrl+Click(Windows) or cmd+click(Mac) so that the ticket will be opened in a new tab)
2. Once the URL is loaded, click on the Chrome extension
3. The backend ticket ID will be copied automatically

Things to take care when you use the extension:
1. The extension will have the last loaded ticket Display ID and backend ticket ID when you click on it make sure the expected display id is shown
2. The extension will not work if you open the ticket on the same tab from list view, you have to open the ticket in a new tab
3. Once you click the extension icon, whatever copied previously will be rewritten with the backend ticket ID.
